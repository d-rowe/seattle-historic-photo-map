At the close of the exposition this building will revert to the University and Washington's seat of learning will be the only educational institution in the world having a building of that character for use of students taking the forestry course. The Forestry building is one of the largest log houses ever built.\"\" The building has a frontage of 320 feet and in width is 144 feet. About the front of the building are 124 logs, each forty feet high, containing 6,000 feet in board measure. The weight of each log is estimated at 50,000 pounds. The logs used on the exterior of the building are left in the rough, while those used in the interior have the bark removed. At each end of the building is a tower built of small logs, reached by a spiral stairway. The building has a balcony for exhibition purposes. The Forestry building is entirely complete and all exhibits were in place thirty days before the exposition opened. The exhibit in the Forestry building is complete in every detail. There is a comprehensive display of timber of various kinds showing the logs just as they leave the forest, besides sections and cross-sections of the big timbers. The various kinds of woods in a finished condition are also displayed and there are many samples showing flooring, paneling, ceiling work and other uses to which wood is put to decorate the interior of residence and office buildings. In connection with the forestry exhibit at the exposition is the timber testing plant located in the machinery hall adjoining the Forestry building. During the progress of the exposition timbers of every kind and all sizes will be tested to the breaking point. this is one of the most instructive demonstrations of the exposition, and is of interest to builders from every part of the country who attend the Seattle exposition.\"",

    "description": "From the Official guide to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition: \"Commandingly located at the head of the South Pay Streak, beneath of a roof of trees, is the picturesquely simple village of the barbaric Igorrotes, the interesting primitive and wild people from the remote mountain fastnesses of Luzon in the Philippine Archipelago. Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"gee-strings\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",
