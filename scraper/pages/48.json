Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"gee-strings\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

    "description": "From the Official guide to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition: \"The Hoo Hoo house on the grounds of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition is a building of the bungalow type and is a haven of rest for all lumbermen who visit the fair. The building is so designed and large enough for association meetings, Hoo Hoo gatherings, concatenations, banquets, dancing parties and receptions. There is a large assemble room, checkrooms and an information bureau, where visiting lumbermen may register and be directed to hotels. Lumbermen will also have the privilege of having their mail addressed in care of the building. One of the special features of the Hoo Hoo building is the ladies reception and waiting rooms where Japanese maids in native costume are in attendance during the progress of the fair. There is also an attractive smoking room for men. The Hoo Hoo building is located near the Forestry building, the larges log house ever built. The funds to construct this building were secured from members of the order. The membership fee was placed at $9.99 and members for the exposition Hoo Hoo building are scattered all over the western states. The Hoo Hoo building is one of the most attractive of the smaller structures on the grounds of the 1909 exhibition. The Hoo Hoo , as everyone knows, is an organization of lumbermen, and since the lumber industry is the largest in the Northwest, thousands of lumbermen, lumber dealers, railroad men, sawmill machinery and supply men, as well as lumber journalists, will no doubt be in Seattle while the fair is open, and the Hoo Hoo building will be their headquarters. The structure was finished and furnished before the exposition opened.\"\"",
