Gould. 1931.\" According to HistoryLink's article \"Thomas Phelps's 1856 map of Seattle is published in the Town Crier on December 15, 1917\": \"Phelps's map depicts what has become known as the Battle of Seattle, when Native Americans battled settlers and the Decatur's crew on January 26, 1856. The death toll for the skirmish, which ended at 10 p.m., was two settlers and an unknown number of Indians. The map provides what appears to be an accurate depiction of the city on that day, although there is one notable mistake. The settlement's northern blockhouse, or fort, is in the wrong location; it should be two blocks south, at what is now Cherry Street. (Phelps also shows a southern blockhouse, which was not built until two weeks or so after the battle.) The only other map to depict Seattle around the time of the battle is a U.S. Coast Survey map of \"Duwamish Bay, W.T.\" Published in 1854, it shows a roughly similar landscape and distribution of buildings.\"",
