The large lock is 80 feet wide and will accommodate vessels with a maximum length of 760 feet and draft of 36 feet. The small lock is 150 feet long and 30 feet wide and will accommodate vessels with a draft of 16 feet. The spillway extending from the small lock to the south shore of Salmon Bay is 240 feel long with six spillway openings, each 32 feet long. A fish ladder for the passage of salmon to the spawning ground above the locks, and an opening for discharging salt water from the upper pool are provided through the dam.
