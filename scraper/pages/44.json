    "description": "From Green Lake's \"About the Branch\" article on spl.org: \"Library service in Green Lake dates back to 1905, when The Seattle Public Library opened a small, one-room structure on the east side of the lake, several blocks south of the present building. The structure was built on a wooden platform. A board sidewalk led from the street and the streetcar tracks to the library. In rainy weather, the tiny building was surrounded by mud and water and young boys begged the librarian for twine so they could fish over the railing.\"",
