A caption on the photograph spl_gpn_065 reads \"Our house 1504 18th Ave. Seattle, corner view with trees, 1910.\" In 1910, this address was home to Walter F. Piper, his mother and sisters. Other images of a man identified as the photographer in this collection include spl_gpn_030, spl_gpn_031, and spl_gpn_115. While this photo and the man pictured in spl_gpn_030 and spl_gpn_031 are clearly the same, is not certain if the same individual is also photographed in this image and spl_gpn_115.",

Teams have already been formed in several of the stores and are practicing daily after working hours. Last year there were several store teams and number of first-class games were played between them. A great difficulty was found, however in arranging dates satisfactory to both sides. For this reason several of the more interested players of last year have promoted the league for this year. Their respective employers have consented to allow them a Saturday afternoon occasionally for a game and a committee of the league is at work preparing a regular schedule. A general meeting of the young men will be called in the near future when officers of the associations for the various teams will be elected. The following business houses will be represented: Seattle Hardware Company, Louch, Augustine *Co., Schwabacher Hardware Co., Mitchell, Lewis & Staver, M. Seller & Co., and A. Hambach & Co. It is possible that several more houses will be represented in the league after the project is a little more matured.\"",
