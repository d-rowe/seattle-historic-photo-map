Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"\"gee-strings\"\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

It was quite generally known throughout its existence was the \"Western Mill.\" David T. Denny, on whose original donation claim it was located, was for a time financially interested in its operation, cutting 25,000 feet daily. Later, in 1883, the second mill was built by a corporation with A. Brewster as President. It originally cut 40,000 feet daily. 'Lake Union' as the district became known, developed quite a little settlement, building largely around these mills, later augmented by a furniture factory, an ice plant, a brewery, two hotels and stores of various kinds. The first mill stood at what is now the intersection of Westlake Avenue with the lake shore. For some years after the mills started operation their supply of logs came from the timber on the shores of the lake itself. Later logs were drifted in from Lake Washington through the \"ditch\" which was dug between the two lakes of sufficient size to float logs.\"",

Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"\"gee-strings\"\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",
