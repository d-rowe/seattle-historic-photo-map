At the left the ancient structure is shown standing, a second before the wrecker touched off the charge. In the center the entire building is shown a fraction of a second after the 200 sticks of dynamite had been exploded. The pillars atop the cupola are shown flying outward as the understructure is crumbling to ruin. At the right the whole mass of masonry is shown falling in a cloud of dust. Two photographers set their camera in such a way as to catch the three bits of action. Each of the men used two cameras to create the above effect. Great care was exercised to set the charge in such a manner that all debris would fall within the four walls. This was accomplished by placing the dynamite in 36 holes bored in the pillars, between the basement and the first floor. R-1-1-31 ABE.FM\"",
