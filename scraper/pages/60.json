She opened school in the spring of 1854 in the building that was originally built to house bachelors of the town. The second year she taught in her own home at the corner of Second Avenue and Cherry Street. The school was known as a subscription school because the parents paid a stipulated sum for the education of their children. The first enrollment list shows the following names: Boys - George N. McConoha. Girls - Mary Mercer, Alice Mercer, Eliza Mercer, Susan Mercer, Ursula McConoha, Laura Bell, Olive Bell, Virginia Bell, Rebecca Horton, Lenora Denny, Loretta Denny, Hulda Phillips, Ruby Willard. The children went to school on Saturday but Monday was a holiday. This was because Monday was \"wash day\" and Mrs. Blaine closed school so she could do her family washing. The first year, the children attended only four months; from January until April. Later Mrs. Blaine became Seattle's first superintendent of schools.\"",
