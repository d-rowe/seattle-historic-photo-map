It was scrapped in February 1948. The same photograph appeared in the Seattle Times on March 11, 1923 with the caption: \"Liner H.F. Alexander in Drydock. After dominating the scenery in the yard of the Todd Dry Docks, Inc., for several weeks, the Admiral Line's huge coastwise speed queen, H.F. Alexander, was returned to the water last week. The vessel's great prow rose to a height that commanded a full view of Harbor Island and the waterways. The photograph gives an idea of the long slender graceful build of the famous ship, her lines enabling her to make the speed that ranks her as being the fastest merchant vessel under the American flag. She will leave the yard March 21 or 22 and will return to the Admiral Line's Seattle-California route Tuesday March 27. She will return to service all tuned up and reconditioned for a great year in the coastwise passenger service.\"",
