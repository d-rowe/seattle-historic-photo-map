South of Street facing north. 1920's. This is a group of similar, substantial, middle-income homes with their neat green lawns, evergreen shrub foundation planting, and varied roofs and porches continuing on down the street exemplified the typical Seattle neighborhood development. The white painted clapboard siding brick fireplaces, unused front yards with service, play yards and garages off the rear alley are particularly representative. The houses were obviously variations of one stock plan, fitting a certain unity to the street. They are good homes with hardwood floors, full basements and hot air heating systems. Many of today's developments still carry on in the spirit of this era, although the value of developing a more complete neighborhood environment with site developments planned for modern living, is having its influence.\"",
