The mill in the foreground was erected late in 1881 and operated under various ownerships until comparatively recent years. It was quite generally known throughout its existence was the \"Western Mill.\" David T. Denny, on whose original donation claim it was located, was for a time financially interested in its operation, cutting 25,000 feet daily. Later, in 1883, the second mill was built by a corporation with A. Brewster as President. It originally cut 40,000 feet daily. 'Lake Union' as the district became known, developed quite a little settlement, building largely around these mills, later augmented by a furniture factory, an ice plant, a brewery, two hotels and stores of various kinds. The first mill stood at what is now the intersection of Westlake Avenue with the lake shore. For some years after the mills started operation their supply of logs came from the timber on the shores of the lake itself. Later logs were drifted in from Lake Washington through the \"ditch\" which was dug between the two lakes of sufficient size to float logs.\"",

    "description": "From the Official guide to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition: \"Commandingly located at the head of the South Pay Streak, beneath of a roof of trees, is the picturesquely simple village of the barbaric Igorrotes, the interesting primitive and wild people from the remote mountain fastnesses of Luzon in the Philippine Archipelago. Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"\"gee-strings\"\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

    "description": "During the early 1900's, there was an increasing press to connect railways with the city of Seattle. The high demand and competition between railways resulted in two railway stations being built directly next to each other at 4th Avenue and Jackson Street. King Street Station (seen at the far right) was constructed in 1906 and can be distinguished by its tower. Union Station, originally known as the Oregon and Washington Station, was not constructed until 1911. Both stations were sometimes referred to as \"\"union stations\"\" due to the fact that multiple railroad lines were shared within the same terminal. Alternative names for Union Station include the Union Depot and the Northern Pacific Great Northern Depot. Notes about the station's architecture can be found on the back of the postcard.",
