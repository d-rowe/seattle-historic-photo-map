All radio listeners are familiar with the bluff, hearty voice of \"Bob\" Nichols, chief announcer for the American Broadcasting Company's Seattle studios. Beginning his radio career as a singer several year[s] ago, Nichols then took up announcing sports and finally was appointed chain announcer. He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, twenty-nine years ago and is over six feet in height, weighing slightly more than two hundred pounds. He was a football, baseball and basketball star at the University of Washington and has covered all of the big Pacific Coast Conference football games for the ABC Network.\" Nichols is featured in the book \"\"Seattle Radio\"\" with the following description: \"\"Bob Nichols started as a singer on the P.I. Station KFC in 1921. By 1927, he was KJR's sports director and doing some of Seattle's first play-by-play broadcasts.\"\"",

Miss Trotter would not be unwilling to kiss the white cat, if she ever needs to lose a pound or two of weight. Convenient Method of Reducing Discovered in Dusty Pages of Ancient Records. Girls! Attention, please, while the maestro tells you something vastly interesting and - perhaps - of vaster importance. A safe, convenient, and logical method of reducing has been discovered - or rather revived and brought out from the dusty shelves of antiquity. Just as logical as - It is just as safe, convenient and logical as many of these modern schemes for eliminating excess poundage. This simple plan, dug up and out by the maestro during many long and laborious hours of burning the midnight mazdas, is known technically as the \"proper\" curvature of the figure thru influence of superstition. And this, translated into ordinary talk, merely means practicing or following out an old rule of superstition. In Ye Olden Days, when authorities on superstition were running high in the affairs of ordinary mortals, one of these savants evolved, declared and published this rule: \"Kiss a white cat; 'twill make you lean.\" There you are, girls! If you don't believe it, just try it. And what, permit the maestro to ask, could be more convenient than kissing a white cat in order to do away with an extra pound or two of weight, so distressing when face to face with the scales? Reverse the Rule. Also, this same savant announced to a surprised world: \"Kiss a black cat; 'twill make you fat.\" There you are again! If you happen to be a bit too thin, the jolly old rule is reversed as to the color of the cat - and the results are supposed to be equally satisfactory. The maestro charges nothing for this information. His interest is purely scientific.\"",

As I look back over my lifetime of four years, I can see many events that had all the qualities of real humor. I laughed at them then at times I break out laughing about them even at this late date. I enjoy laughing. Frequently I feel like laughing. And so I laugh. Laughing is a tonic during and after routine of one's profession. It is good for a person, and I simply cannot figure out why more fold do not cultivate the habit. My work brings me before the public a great deal. I'm master of ceremonies for an orchestra and also I play violin at public entertainments. The newer generation of masters of ceremonies are going in strong for more laughs. Now I know it really is not polite to laugh at our public, but sometimes I just cannot help it. So many of the public are so intensely concentrated on something or other. They look glum and often they weep. They even weep at weddings. That doesn't seem at all logical. I prefer to laugh at weddings. The bridegrooms look so funny. And the brides are so very sweet.\" (Editor's note: Mr. Le May is a member of Seattle's Baby Orchestra, which is composed of 10 children ranging in age from 2 1/2 to 9 years.)\" The same photo (with a different caption) appeared in the Seattle Times on November 25, 1932.",
