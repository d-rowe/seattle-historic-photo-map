The arrival of the Hyas Golden Potlatch Tyee from the Land of the North. The Hyas Tyee, attended by his tribal chiefs, his Shamans and other dignitaries of this barbaric court, arrives in Elliott Bay on the Goldship Portland. Accompanying him are many \"sourdoughs,\" pioneers of hte North, who bring with them the first golden nuggets found in the Great Yukon. They have their \"pokes,\" their picturesque dog sleds and other equipment of the Northern trails and they come attired in the queer dress of the North, in parks, muk-luka and all the rest. This weird crew will leave the goldship in the stream and make its landing on the waterfront, where the Hyas Tyee and his people will be greeted by the Tilikums of Elttaes who will escort them to the Grandstand on Fourth Avenue between Lenora and Blanchard Streets, where the opening ceremonies will be performed.\" Location of photograph presumed to be at Grandstand based on newspaper program.",
