    "description": "According to the library's 1914 annual report: \"In August the library conducted an aeroplane contest managed by Miss Hunter, children's librarian of the University branch. The original plan was for a contest among the boys of the University District only, but the interest was so widespread that it was finally opened to all the boys in the city. With the help of Mr. Howard Stine, playground director of the Park Department, and the playground instructors, the field arrangements were made and two contests were held a week apart. Prizes were donated by various interested people of the city and much newspaper publicity was secured. One of the large department stores displayed the prices in its window together with some of the models entered. , and moving pictures of the meet were shown at a local theater the following week. The books on model aeroplanes are in constant circulation and there is great interest in the possibility of another contest in 1915. Many boys who formerly regarded the library as a place to prepare lessons, now look upon it as a source of information on subjects in which they are keenly interested.\" An August 27, 1914 Seattle Star article lists the location of the meet at the Optimo Playfield at 29th Ave. and E. Cherry St. An August 20, 1914 article in the Seattle Times which announced the rules for the competition refers to the field as Optimo Grounds.",

About 600 books purchased for the Yesler Branch, which opened in September, were shelved in the library enclosure and these were circulated to children holding library cards. At one end of the space were seven screens telling of library activities by means of photographs and posters. Special shelves were reserved for books recommended for a child's own library, a collection of undesirable books for children, and a list of books for mothers concerning care of children. A list of books for a child's own library was distributed and a pamphlet called \"Library babies are better babies\" was given out. Attendants were always in charge to explain the work of the library to visitors, and the grown people were so interested that at times the children were crowded out.\" The Armory Building that housed the exhibit stood from 1909 to 1968 in the location now occupied by Victor Steinbrueck Park.",

The original plan was for a contest among the boys of the University District only, but the interest was so widespread that it was finally opened to all the boys in the city. With the help of Mr. Howard Stine, playground director of the Park Department, and the playground instructors, the field arrangements were made and two contests were held a week apart. Prizes were donated by various interested people of the city and much newspaper publicity was secured. One of the large department stores displayed the prices in its window together with some of the models entered. , and moving pictures of the meet were shown at a local theater the following week. The books on model aeroplanes are in constant circulation and there is great interest in the possibility of another contest in 1915. Many boys who formerly regarded the library as a place to prepare lessons, now look upon it as a source of information on subjects in which they are keenly interested.\" An August 27, 1914 Seattle Star article lists the location of the meet at the Optimo Playfield at 29th Ave. and E. Cherry St. An August 20, 1914 article in the Seattle Times which announced the rules for the competition refers to the field as Optimo Grounds.",

About 600 books purchased for the Yesler Branch, which opened in September, were shelved in the library enclosure and these were circulated to children holding library cards. At one end of the space were seven screens telling of library activities by means of photographs and posters. Special shelves were reserved for books recommended for a child's own library, a collection of undesirable books for children, and a list of books for mothers concerning care of children. A list of books for a child's own library was distributed and a pamphlet called \"Library babies are better babies\" was given out. Attendants were always in charge to explain the work of the library to visitors, and the grown people were so interested that at times the children were crowded out.\" The Armory Building that housed the exhibit stood from 1909 to 1968 in the location now occupied by Victor Steinbrueck Park.",
