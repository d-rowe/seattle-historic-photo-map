Money has already been appropriated  by the directors to buy uniforms and equipment. It is proposed to arrange a schedule of games between the local club and Multnomah and Spokane Athletic Clubs; the University of Washington, the Seattle High School and probably some of the amateur teams in and around the city. The manager of the team will not go outside of the club membership for material. There are so many ball players who, while they are not professionals in the sense that they follow the game as an avocation, still they would have trouble qualifying as amateurs, so no chances will be taken on having men protested. Barry, of last year's football team, is a good ball player; Brown is another man with a good record; Fowler is a clever southpaw, and in fact there is a lot of material that has only to be tried out to give the club a winning aggregation.\"",

Their respective employers have consented to allow them a Saturday afternoon occasionally for a game and a committee of the league is at work preparing a regular schedule. A general meeting of the young men will be called in the near future when officers of the associations for the various teams will be elected. The following business houses will be represented: Seattle Hardware Company, Louch, Augustine *Co., Schwabacher Hardware Co., Mitchell, Lewis & Staver, M. Seller & Co., and A. Hambach & Co. It is possible that several more houses will be represented in the league after the project is a little more matured.\"",

Money has already been appropriated  by the directors to buy uniforms and equipment. It is proposed to arrange a schedule of games between the local club and Multnomah and Spokane Athletic Clubs; the University of Washington, the Seattle High School and probably some of the amateur teams in and around the city. The manager of the team will not go outside of the club membership for material. There are so many ball players who, while they are not professionals in the sense that they follow the game as an avocation, still they would have trouble qualifying as amateurs, so no chances will be taken on having men protested. Barry, of last year's football team, is a good ball player; Brown is another man with a good record; Fowler is a clever southpaw, and in fact there is a lot of material that has only to be tried out to give the club a winning aggregation.\"",

Teams have already been formed in several of the stores and are practicing daily after working hours. Last year there were several store teams and number of first-class games were played between them. A great difficulty was found, however in arranging dates satisfactory to both sides. For this reason several of the more interested players of last year have promoted the league for this year. Their respective employers have consented to allow them a Saturday afternoon occasionally for a game and a committee of the league is at work preparing a regular schedule.
