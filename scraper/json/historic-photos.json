Stewart Street Baptist Church, erected 70-75 years ago \") by a German Methodist Congregation bought by present owners in 1905. Basement put in later and other alterations made in 1925. Photograph taken 1951 but scene shown in photo is same as of this date of this date of August 23, 1952. Adjoining old house in true Victorian style has for sale sign on lawn now. County records do not give either record of erection of Church or old house. Later is private residence and not the parsonage of the church. A large photograph of this scene and other architecture of Seattle in retrospect is now on view at the Henry Art Gallery until Oct. 9th. 76 in all.\"",

South of Street facing north. 1920's. This is a group of similar, substantial, middle-income homes with their neat green lawns, evergreen shrub foundation planting, and varied roofs and porches continuing on down the street exemplified the typical Seattle neighborhood development. The white painted clapboard siding brick fireplaces, unused front yards with service, play yards and garages off the rear alley are particularly representative. The houses were obviously variations of one stock plan, fitting a certain unity to the street. They are good homes with hardwood floors, full basements and hot air heating systems. Many of today's developments still carry on in the spirit of this era, although the value of developing a more complete neighborhood environment with site developments planned for modern living, is having its influence.\"",
