# Seattle Historic Photo Map

This project is intended to connect people to the rich history of Seattle through the exploration of historic photos on an interactive map.

This project will firstly need a scraper to scrape the city's [Historical Photograph Collection](https://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15015coll4/search) to extract photos, coordinates, title, identifier, and description into a database.

The front end is comprised of a leaflet map which will have markers at each photo's coordinate and will have a popup that displays the photo and relevant information about it.
