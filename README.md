# Seattle Historic Photo Map

Interactive map of Seattle's historic photos.  The data for this project was scraped from the Seattle Public Library's [Historical Photograph Collection](https://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15015coll4).  Fortunately, the vast majority of these historical photos had coordinate data I could use to generate geojson with and map with Mapbox GL.
