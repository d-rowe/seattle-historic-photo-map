The Hyas Tyee, attended by his tribal chiefs, his Shamans and other dignitaries of this barbaric court, arrives in Elliott Bay on the Goldship Portland.

They have their \"pokes,\" their picturesque dog sleds and other equipment of the Northern trails and they come attired in the queer dress of the North, in parks, muk-luka and all the rest. This weird crew will leave the goldship in the stream and make its landing on the waterfront, where the Hyas Tyee and his people will be greeted by the Tilikums of Elttaes who will escort them to the Grandstand on Fourth Avenue between Lenora and Blanchard Streets, where the opening ceremonies will be performed.\" Location of photograph presumed to be at Grandstand based on newspaper program.",

South of Street facing north. 1920's. This is a group of similar, substantial, middle-income homes with their neat green lawns, evergreen shrub foundation planting, and varied roofs and porches continuing on down the street exemplified the typical Seattle neighborhood development. The white painted clapboard siding brick fireplaces, unused front yards with service, play yards and garages off the rear alley are particularly representative. The houses were obviously variations of one stock plan, fitting a certain unity to the street. They are good homes with hardwood floors, full basements and hot air heating systems. Many of today's developments still carry on in the spirit of this era, although the value of developing a more complete neighborhood environment with site developments planned for modern living, is having its influence.\"",

At the left the ancient structure is shown standing, a second before the wrecker touched off the charge. In the center the entire building is shown a fraction of a second after the 200 sticks of dynamite had been exploded. The pillars atop the cupola are shown flying outward as the understructure is crumbling to ruin. At the right the whole mass of masonry is shown falling in a cloud of dust. Two photographers set their camera in such a way as to catch the three bits of action. Each of the men used two cameras to create the above effect. Great care was exercised to set the charge in such a manner that all debris would fall within the four walls. This was accomplished by placing the dynamite in 36 holes bored in the pillars, between the basement and the first floor. R-1-1-31 ABE.FM\"",

Stacey, First Methodist [Episcopal] Church, Third and Marion. The First Presbyterian Church, pictured here, was the first structure erected for the congregation, built in 1877, with the first services in the building held on the first Sunday of July of that year; Rev. Theodore Crown then minister. Church Moved in 1893 to 4th and Spring, and again in 1907 to the present site at Seventh and Spring. Amos Miller site now part of a combined business structure. Stacey home now stands on top of a one story brick block, being used for a French restaurant. This First Methodist Church building erected in 1887, was an outgrowth of the city's first church, known as the \"Little White Church\" built at 2nd and Columbia, in the early 50's. The property at Third and Marion was sold in 1907 and the congregation established-in a new church at 5th and Marion still in use.\"",

Last year there were several store teams and number of first-class games were played between them. A great difficulty was found, however in arranging dates satisfactory to both sides.

The employees of the company have a crack baseball team, and the half holiday will give them the opportunity to play.\" In 1901, a Commercial Baseball League formed in Seattle including employees from various Seattle businesses. Seattle Times, April 19, 1901: \"The employees of a number of the leading business houses of the city have held a conference and announce that they will have a commercial baseball league this season. Teams have already been formed in several of the stores and are practicing daily after working hours. Last year there were several store teams and number of first-class games were played between them. A great difficulty was found, however in arranging dates satisfactory to both sides. For this reason several of the more interested players of last year have promoted the league for this year. Their respective employers have consented to allow them a Saturday afternoon occasionally for a game and a committee of the league is at work preparing a regular schedule. A general meeting of the young men will be called in the near future when officers of the associations for the various teams will be elected. The following business houses will be represented: Seattle Hardware Company, Louch, Augustine *Co., Schwabacher Hardware Co., Mitchell, Lewis & Staver, M. Seller & Co., and A. Hambach & Co. It is possible that several more houses will be represented in the league after the project is a little more matured.\"",

Seattle Times, April 19, 1901:\" \"The employees of a number of the leading business houses of the city have held a conference and announce that they will have a commercial baseball league this season. Teams have already been formed in several of the stores and are practicing daily after working hours. Last year there were several store teams and number of first-class games were played between them. A great difficulty was found, however in arranging dates satisfactory to both sides. For this reason several of the more interested players of last year have promoted the league for this year. Their respective employers have consented to allow them a Saturday afternoon occasionally for a game and a committee of the league is at work preparing a regular schedule. A general meeting of the young men will be called in the near future when officers of the associations for the various teams will be elected. The following business houses will be represented: Seattle Hardware Company, Louch, Augustine *Co., Schwabacher Hardware Co., Mitchell, Lewis & Staver, M. Seller & Co., and A. Hambach & Co. It is possible that several more houses will be represented in the league after the project is a little more matured.\"",

Hall at today's (1999) NE 72nd Street and 5th Avenue NE, above Baskin & Robbins. This temperance hall was home for three class rooms of second through fifth grade children during the 1901-02 school year.\"",

Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"gee-strings\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

The building is so designed and large enough for association meetings, Hoo Hoo gatherings, concatenations, banquets, dancing parties and receptions. There is a large assemble room, checkrooms and an information bureau, where visiting lumbermen may register and be directed to hotels. Lumbermen will also have the privilege of having their mail addressed in care of the building. One of the special features of the Hoo Hoo building is the ladies reception and waiting rooms where Japanese maids in native costume are in attendance during the progress of the fair. There is also an attractive smoking room for men. The Hoo Hoo building is located near the Forestry building, the larges log house ever built. The funds to construct this building were secured from members of the order. The membership fee was placed at $9.99 and members for the exposition Hoo Hoo building are scattered all over the western states. The Hoo Hoo building is one of the most attractive of the smaller structures on the grounds of the 1909 exhibition. The Hoo Hoo , as everyone knows, is an organization of lumbermen, and since the lumber industry is the largest in the Northwest, thousands of lumbermen, lumber dealers, railroad men, sawmill machinery and supply men, as well as lumber journalists, will no doubt be in Seattle while the fair is open, and the Hoo Hoo building will be their headquarters. The structure was finished and furnished before the exposition opened.\"\"",

At the close of the exposition this building will revert to the University and Washington's seat of learning will be the only educational institution in the world having a building of that character for use of students taking the forestry course. The Forestry building is one of the largest log houses ever built.\"\" The building has a frontage of 320 feet and in width is 144 feet. About the front of the building are 124 logs, each forty feet high, containing 6,000 feet in board measure. The weight of each log is estimated at 50,000 pounds. The logs used on the exterior of the building are left in the rough, while those used in the interior have the bark removed. At each end of the building is a tower built of small logs, reached by a spiral stairway. The building has a balcony for exhibition purposes. The Forestry building is entirely complete and all exhibits were in place thirty days before the exposition opened. The exhibit in the Forestry building is complete in every detail. There is a comprehensive display of timber of various kinds showing the logs just as they leave the forest, besides sections and cross-sections of the big timbers. The various kinds of woods in a finished condition are also displayed and there are many samples showing flooring, paneling, ceiling work and other uses to which wood is put to decorate the interior of residence and office buildings. In connection with the forestry exhibit at the exposition is the timber testing plant located in the machinery hall adjoining the Forestry building. During the progress of the exposition timbers of every kind and all sizes will be tested to the breaking point. this is one of the most instructive demonstrations of the exposition, and is of interest to builders from every part of the country who attend the Seattle exposition.\"",

Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"gee-strings\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

In 1878 they bought the block at 5th and Madison on which the building shown in this foot was erected. The first section built is shown as being the little left-hand corner. Next came the center section in 1882 and a few years later the first section, completing the structure as shown. This foot was evidently taken in 1889 or 1890, before the Madison Street cable line was placed in operation in 1890. The last and present Providence Hospital, at 17th and Jefferson Street, was built in 1911 and the old property sold. In recent years the government took over this original hospital block and now have erected a magnificent Federal Court house building on the site.\"\"",

Union Station, originally known as the Oregon and Washington Station, was constructed in 1911. (Alternative names for Union Station include the Union Depot and the Northern Pacific Great Northern Depot.) Both stations were sometimes referred to as \"\"union stations\"\" or \"\"union depots\"\" due to the fact that multiple railroad lines were shared within the same terminal.",

The original plan was for a contest among the boys of the University District only, but the interest was so widespread that it was finally opened to all the boys in the city. With the help of Mr. Howard Stine, playground director of the Park Department, and the playground instructors, the field arrangements were made and two contests were held a week apart. Prizes were donated by various interested people of the city and much newspaper publicity was secured. One of the large department stores displayed the prices in its window together with some of the models entered. , and moving pictures of the meet were shown at a local theater the following week. The books on model aeroplanes are in constant circulation and there is great interest in the possibility of another contest in 1915. Many boys who formerly regarded the library as a place to prepare lessons, now look upon it as a source of information on subjects in which they are keenly interested.\" An August 27, 1914 Seattle Star article lists the location of the meet at the Optimo Playfield at 29th Ave. and E. Cherry St. An August 20, 1914 article in the Seattle Times which announced the rules for the competition refers to the field as Optimo Grounds.",

About 600 books purchased for the Yesler Branch, which opened in September, were shelved in the library enclosure and these were circulated to children holding library cards. At one end of the space were seven screens telling of library activities by means of photographs and posters. Special shelves were reserved for books recommended for a child's own library, a collection of undesirable books for children, and a list of books for mothers concerning care of children. A list of books for a child's own library was distributed and a pamphlet called \"Library babies are better babies\" was given out. Attendants were always in charge to explain the work of the library to visitors, and the grown people were so interested that at times the children were crowded out.\" The Armory Building that housed the exhibit stood from 1909 to 1968 in the location now occupied by Victor Steinbrueck Park.",

      "description": "According to the library's 1914 annual report: \"In August the library conducted an aeroplane contest managed by Miss Hunter, children's librarian of the University branch. The original plan was for a contest among the boys of the University District only, but the interest was so widespread that it was finally opened to all the boys in the city. With the help of Mr. Howard Stine, playground director of the Park Department, and the playground instructors, the field arrangements were made and two contests were held a week apart. Prizes were donated by various interested people of the city and much newspaper publicity was secured. One of the large department stores displayed the prices in its window together with some of the models entered. , and moving pictures of the meet were shown at a local theater the following week. The books on model aeroplanes are in constant circulation and there is great interest in the possibility of another contest in 1915. Many boys who formerly regarded the library as a place to prepare lessons, now look upon it as a source of information on subjects in which they are keenly interested.\" An August 27, 1914 Seattle Star article lists the location of the meet at the Optimo Playfield at 29th Ave. and E. Cherry St. An August 20, 1914 article in the Seattle Times which announced the rules for the competition refers to the field as Optimo Grounds.",

About 600 books purchased for the Yesler Branch, which opened in September, were shelved in the library enclosure and these were circulated to children holding library cards. At one end of the space were seven screens telling of library activities by means of photographs and posters. Special shelves were reserved for books recommended for a child's own library, a collection of undesirable books for children, and a list of books for mothers concerning care of children. A list of books for a child's own library was distributed and a pamphlet called \"Library babies are better babies\" was given out. Attendants were always in charge to explain the work of the library to visitors, and the grown people were so interested that at times the children were crowded out.\" The Armory Building that housed the exhibit stood from 1909 to 1968 in the location now occupied by Victor Steinbrueck Park.",

The original plan was for a contest among the boys of the University District only, but the interest was so widespread that it was finally opened to all the boys in the city. With the help of Mr. Howard Stine, playground director of the Park Department, and the playground instructors, the field arrangements were made and two contests were held a week apart. Prizes were donated by various interested people of the city and much newspaper publicity was secured. One of the large department stores displayed the prices in its window together with some of the models entered. , and moving pictures of the meet were shown at a local theater the following week. The books on model aeroplanes are in constant circulation and there is great interest in the possibility of another contest in 1915. Many boys who formerly regarded the library as a place to prepare lessons, now look upon it as a source of information on subjects in which they are keenly interested.\" An August 27, 1914 Seattle Star article lists the location of the meet at the Optimo Playfield at 29th Ave. and E. Cherry St. An August 20, 1914 article in the Seattle Times which announced the rules for the competition refers to the field as Optimo Grounds.",

      "description": "According to the library's 1914 annual report: \"In August the library conducted an aeroplane contest managed by Miss Hunter, children's librarian of the University branch. The original plan was for a contest among the boys of the University District only, but the interest was so widespread that it was finally opened to all the boys in the city. With the help of Mr. Howard Stine, playground director of the Park Department, and the playground instructors, the field arrangements were made and two contests were held a week apart. Prizes were donated by various interested people of the city and much newspaper publicity was secured. One of the large department stores displayed the prices in its window together with some of the models entered. , and moving pictures of the meet were shown at a local theater the following week. The books on model aeroplanes are in constant circulation and there is great interest in the possibility of another contest in 1915. Many boys who formerly regarded the library as a place to prepare lessons, now look upon it as a source of information on subjects in which they are keenly interested.\" An August 27, 1914 Seattle Star article lists the location of the meet at the Optimo Playfield at 29th Ave. and E. Cherry St. An August 20, 1914 article in the Seattle Times which announced the rules for the competition refers to the field as Optimo Grounds.",

About 600 books purchased for the Yesler Branch, which opened in September, were shelved in the library enclosure and these were circulated to children holding library cards. At one end of the space were seven screens telling of library activities by means of photographs and posters. Special shelves were reserved for books recommended for a child's own library, a collection of undesirable books for children, and a list of books for mothers concerning care of children. A list of books for a child's own library was distributed and a pamphlet called \"Library babies are better babies\" was given out. Attendants were always in charge to explain the work of the library to visitors, and the grown people were so interested that at times the children were crowded out.\" The Armory Building that housed the exhibit stood from 1909 to 1968 in the location now occupied by Victor Steinbrueck Park.",

A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"\"gee-strings\"\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

The mill in the foreground was erected late in 1881 and operated under various ownerships until comparatively recent years. It was quite generally known throughout its existence was the \"Western Mill.\" David T. Denny, on whose original donation claim it was located, was for a time financially interested in its operation, cutting 25,000 feet daily. Later, in 1883, the second mill was built by a corporation with A. Brewster as President. It originally cut 40,000 feet daily. 'Lake Union' as the district became known, developed quite a little settlement, building largely around these mills, later augmented by a furniture factory, an ice plant, a brewery, two hotels and stores of various kinds. The first mill stood at what is now the intersection of Westlake Avenue with the lake shore. For some years after the mills started operation their supply of logs came from the timber on the shores of the lake itself. Later logs were drifted in from Lake Washington through the \"ditch\" which was dug between the two lakes of sufficient size to float logs.\"",

Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"\"gee-strings\"\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

The mill in the foreground was erected late in 1881 and operated under various ownerships until comparatively recent years. It was quite generally known throughout its existence was the \"Western Mill.\" David T. Denny, on whose original donation claim it was located, was for a time financially interested in its operation, cutting 25,000 feet daily. Later, in 1883, the second mill was built by a corporation with A. Brewster as President. It originally cut 40,000 feet daily. 'Lake Union' as the district became known, developed quite a little settlement, building largely around these mills, later augmented by a furniture factory, an ice plant, a brewery, two hotels and stores of various kinds. The first mill stood at what is now the intersection of Westlake Avenue with the lake shore. For some years after the mills started operation their supply of logs came from the timber on the shores of the lake itself. Later logs were drifted in from Lake Washington through the \"ditch\" which was dug between the two lakes of sufficient size to float logs.\"",

Here, in the greatest of all the special attractions, there are fifty of these strange head-hunting, dog-eating people, living as they live at home, in quint grass-thatched huts, with their womenkind and cute little children. A bit of their own characteristic Bontoc country transplanted in Seattle to show exposition visitors the manners, customs, costumes, industries, sports and pastimes of a remarkable people in the childhood of a race, a wild, uncultured people, struggling to break through their environment and emerge from the superstitions which enslave them, and to solve the mysterious play of the forces of nature and rise to higher conceptions of truth of freedom and liberty. Within the great palisaded enclosure there is not one inch of space that does not vibrate with the wild life of the Igorrotes. Everything they make and use at home is made in the Village here, men fashioning keen spears and warlike head axes at a primitive forge, or weaving rattan into peculiar pocket hats which distinguish the Bontoc men from all other Islanders; men carving war shields with crude tools, and quiet turbaned men from Sebangan molding clay and brass pipes and ornamental metal chains. Women spinning and weaving cotton into the gaudy \"\"gee-strings\"\" worn by the warriors, as well as the gay cloths for their own simple but sufficient clothing; others beating and winnowing rice, and many of both sexes laboring in the remarkable \"sementeras\" which terrace the mountainside at the rear of the Village, where rice is grown under irrigation as practiced by them at home. All in all, it is the most extensive, interesting and amusing exhibit at the exposition.\"",

The high demand and competition between railways resulted in two railway stations being built directly next to each other at 4th Avenue and Jackson Street. King Street Station (seen at the far right) was constructed in 1906 and can be distinguished by its tower. Union Station, originally known as the Oregon and Washington Station, was not constructed until 1911. Both stations were sometimes referred to as \"\"union stations\"\" due to the fact that multiple railroad lines were shared within the same terminal. Alternative names for Union Station include the Union Depot and the Northern Pacific Great Northern Depot. Notes about the station's architecture can be found on the back of the postcard.",

It was scrapped in February 1948. The same photograph appeared in the Seattle Times on March 11, 1923 with the caption: \"Liner H.F. Alexander in Drydock. After dominating the scenery in the yard of the Todd Dry Docks, Inc., for several weeks, the Admiral Line's huge coastwise speed queen, H.F. Alexander, was returned to the water last week. The vessel's great prow rose to a height that commanded a full view of Harbor Island and the waterways. The photograph gives an idea of the long slender graceful build of the famous ship, her lines enabling her to make the speed that ranks her as being the fastest merchant vessel under the American flag. She will leave the yard March 21 or 22 and will return to the Admiral Line's Seattle-California route Tuesday March 27. She will return to service all tuned up and reconditioned for a great year in the coastwise passenger service.\"",

The small lock is 150 feet long and 30 feet wide and will accommodate vessels with a draft of 16 feet. The spillway extending from the small lock to the south shore of Salmon Bay is 240 feel long with six spillway openings, each 32 feet long. A fish ladder for the passage of salmon to the spawning ground above the locks, and an opening for discharging salt water from the upper pool are provided through the dam.
